# batch-scripts
A collection of random batch scripts I've made.

### network-reset
Resets/restarts Windows networking-related components.

### rebuild-icon-cache
Fully deletes and rebuilds Windows icon cache.

### win11-set-doh
Automatically sets DNS servers and enables DNS over HTTPS for every relevant networking interface for both IPv4 and IPv6 on Windows 11.
You can set what DNS servers you want to use at the top of the file.
If you want to use a DoH service not already built into Windows 11, see [here](https://www.elevenforum.com/t/enable-dns-over-https-doh-in-windows-11.280/post-7558).
